# Demo Contract - GetAndSetTime

This is a demo project based on the template to build secret contracts in Rust to run in
[Secret Network](https://github.com/enigmampc/SecretNetwork).

## Introduction

This is a just demo contract allowed interactions of `Get` and `Set` time. Every time when `SetTime` is triggered, the time will be set to the current time, and calling `GetTime` will get a respone of the time when last `SetTime` is called.
